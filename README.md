Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to move on from my current role at [Company Name]. My last working day will be 28th November.

This decision comes with a mix of gratitude and excitement — gratitude for the incredible journey here, and excitement because what I’ve always dreamed of is now turning into reality. I truly appreciate all the learning opportunities, support, and experiences that have shaped me both professionally and personally.

I will ensure a smooth transition and plan to schedule knowledge transfer (KT) sessions after the 31st release to hand over all responsibilities seamlessly.

Thank you once again for everything — it’s been an honor being part of this team. I hope to stay in touch and wish continued success to the organization and everyone I’ve worked with.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
